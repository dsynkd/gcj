# T9 Spelling

The Latin alphabet contains 26 characters and telephones only have ten digits on the keypad. We would like to make it easier to write a message to your friend using a sequence of keypresses to indicate the desired characters. To insert the character B for instance, the program would press 22. In order to insert two characters in sequence from the same key, the user must pause before pressing the key a second time. The space character ' ' should be printed to indicate a pause. For example, 2 2 indicates AA whereas 22 indicates B.

## Input

The first line of input gives the number of cases, N. N test cases follow. Each case is a line of text formatted as

~~~~~
desired_message
~~~~~

Each message will consist of only lowercase characters a-z and space characters ' '. Pressing zero emits a space.

## Output

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: " followed by the message translated into the sequence of keypresses.

## Limits

1 ≤ N ≤ 100.

Small dataset

1 ≤ length of message in characters ≤ 15.

Large dataset

1 ≤ length of message in characters ≤ 1000.
